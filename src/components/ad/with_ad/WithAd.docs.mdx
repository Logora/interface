The WithAd wrapper allows to display an ad unit below components.

It is useful in lists when the frequency of ads needs to be controlled.

Use the `index` and `frequency` props to displays ads every {frequency} items.

Other props such as ad path, sizes, targeting and consent management are passed to the underlying [AdUnit](bit.cloud/logora/debate/ad/ad_unit) component.

### Component usage

```js
    import { WithAd } from '@logora/debate.ad.with_ad';
```

```js
<WithAd
    index={2}
    id={"ad-id"}
    adPath={"/path"}
    sizes={[[300, 250]]}
    frequency={3}
>
    <div>Hello world !</div>
</WithAd>
```
