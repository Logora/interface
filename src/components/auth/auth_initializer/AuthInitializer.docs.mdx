description: A component to manage authentication
labels: ['auth', 'authentication', 'oauth2']
---

This component is used to manage authentication. It is responsible for initializing authentication, like logging in a user, and also handles logout and token refresh requests.
It can be used as a standalone to trigger authentication and manage user token.

Three authentication methods are available :
- social : email, Google and Facebook authentication
- oauth2_server : authentication with an OAuth2 server using the authorization code flow
- jwt : authentication using a JWT token

Authentication can be triggered using a Javascript event `logora:authentication:require`.


### Component usage

```js
import { AuthInitializer } from '@logora/debate.auth.auth_initializer';
```

```js
const Component = () => {
	return (
        <>
            <AuthInitializer authType={"social"} provider={"my-app"} assertion={"random-assertion"} />
        </>
    )
}
```

```js
window.dispatchEvent(new Event("logora:authentication:require"));
```
