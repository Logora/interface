This library contains several hooks and classes to manage user authentication.
It manages user login, token storage and user logout.

Here are the different classes available and hooks :

- `AuthContext`: a context to store current user and login state.

- `AuthProvider`: a provider to use the context in your app, with the following variables :
    - `currentUser`, `setCurrentUser`: current logged in user object
    - `isLoggedIn`, `setIsLoggedIn`: boolean to define if user is logged in
    - `isLoggingIn` , `setIsLoggingIn`: boolean to define is user is currently logging in
    - `authError`, `setAuthError`: authentication error, empty if auth was successful

- `useAuth`: a hook to get the AuthContext.

- `AuthStorage`: manages token storage. It uses local storage by default or session storage if local storage is not available.

- `useAuthActions`: exports three functions :
    - `loginUser`: fetches user token from API
    - `logoutUser`: logs out user and removes token
    - `fetchUser`: fetches user profile and stores it in context

- `authTokenHandler`: manages tokens retrieval and refresh from API.

- `useAuthInterceptor`: a hook that adds an interceptor to the httpClient (typically axios) to refresh token when expired.
