description: A component to share a link on social networks.

import { ShareBox } from './ShareBox';
import { IntlProvider } from 'react-intl';

A component that shows icons to share a link or to copy to clipboard.

It should be wrapped around [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)'s IntlProvider.

### Component usage
```js
<IntlProvider locale="fr">
    <ShareBox 
        shareUrl="https://example.com/share-link"
        shareTitle="Here is an interesting link"
        shareText="Hello, I stumbled upon this interesting article about asteroids. You should check it out !"
    />
</IntlProvider>
```
