description: A share button component.
---

import { ShareButton } from './ShareButton';
import { IntlProvider } from 'react-intl';

A button that opens ShareBox on click on desktop, and the navigator's native share dialog on mobile.

Share URL and text will be passed to the different share options.

It must be wrapped around [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)'s IntlProvider.

It must be inside [IconProvider](https://bit.cloud/logora/debate/icons/icon_provider).

### Component usage
```js
<IntlProvider locale="fr">
    <ShareButton
        showText 
        shareUrl="https://example.com/share-link"
        shareTitle="Here is an interesting link"
        shareText="Hello, I stumbled upon this interesting article about asteroids. You should check it out !"
    />
</IntlProvider>
```
