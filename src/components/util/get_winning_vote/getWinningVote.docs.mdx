description: A function to calculate the current winning side of a vote object
---

This function receives two arguments, _votesCountObj_, which is an object and _positions_ which is also an object.

It returns an object containing two keys : the winningPositionObj and totalVotes.


### Component usage
```js
import { getWinningVote } from '@logora/debate.util.get_winning_vote';
```
```js
const ComponentNeedingWinningVote = () => {
    const votesCountObj = {
        644: "2",
        645: "1",
        646: "0",
        total: "3"
    }
    
    const positions = [
		{
			id: 644,
			name: "Oui"
		},
		{
			id: 645,
			name: " Non"
		},
		{
			id: 646,
			name: " Sans opinion"
		}
	]

    const winningPositionObj = getWinningVote(votesCountObj, positions);
	return (
        <div>
            {winningPositionObj.winningPositionObj}
            {/* { "count": 2, "id": "644", "name": "Oui"} */}
            {winningPositionObj.totalVotes}
            {/* { 2 } */}
        </div>
    )
}
