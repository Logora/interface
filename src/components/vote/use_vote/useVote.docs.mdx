`useVote` is a custom hook designed to handle the voting system in our application. It provides a set of values and functions to manage votes.

## Returns

`useVote` returns an object with the following properties:

1. `totalUpvotes`: The total number of upvotes for the voteable item.
2. `totalDownvotes`: The total number of downvotes for the voteable item.
3. `activeVote`: A boolean indicating whether a vote is active or not.
4. `voteSide`: A boolean indicating whether the active vote is an upvote (true) or a downvote (false).
5. `handleVote`: A function that can be called to trigger a vote.

### Component usage

```js
import { useVote } from "@logora/debate.hooks.use_vote";
```

```js
function VotingComponent({ voteableType, voteableId, upvotes, downvotes }) {
  const { totalUpvotes, totalDownvotes, handleVote } = useVote(
    voteableType,
    voteableId,
    upvotes,
    downvotes
  );

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleVote(true)}>Upvote</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleVote(false)}>Downvote</button>
      <p>Upvotes: {totalUpvotes}</p>
      <p>Downvotes: {totalDownvotes}</p>
    </div>
  );
