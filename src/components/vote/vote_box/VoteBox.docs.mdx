VoteBox.jsx is a React component that represents a voting box for a debate or group. 

This component allows users to vote on different positions in the debate. 

It handles user authentication, displaying voting options, vote count, and percentage distribution.

### Component usage

```js
import { VoteBox } from '@logora/debate.vote.vote_box';
```

```js
const votePositions = [
    {
        id: 900,
        language: null,
        name: "Yes",
    },
    {
        id: 901,
        language: null,
        name: "No",
    }
];

const votes: {
    900: "10",
    901: "8",
    total: "18"
};

<VoteBox 
    voteableId={23}
    voteableType={"Group"} 
    votes={votes}
    votePositions={votePositions}
    displayColumn
/>
